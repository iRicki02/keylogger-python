# Python keylogger for Windows

<h3>A simple keylogger for Windows, which records and sends the log via email</h3>

Usage:

1. Install pip module pynput via `pip install pynput`
2. **Run firstly the keylog.py module**
3. Digit any key or create the file log.txt in the same directory. **Without log.txt file the module send_mail will not work**
4. Run the second module send_mail.py to send email report

How to hide:
* Change file extensions from .py to .pyw. This will launch the program without the console

Notes:
* Tested on Windows 7 and 10 with python 3.5.2. Should work with both python2 and python3
